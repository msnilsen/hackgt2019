            <h3 style="padding-bottom: .5em"> Addressing Housing Inequality in the State of Georgia  </h3>
            <p>Housing inequality has been increasing since the 1970’s according to the US Census Surveys.
                Housing becomes relatively more expensive the closer one moves toward a work site. Because
                families with lower income levels often cannot afford high transportation costs, they are
                forced to live in inner-city locations in order to be close to employment opportunities. In
                order to win this spatial competition for housing-near-work sites, low-income families must
                compensate for high-priced living by accepting smaller housing, lower-quality housing, or both.</p>
            <p>
                After looking at the challenges presented on HackGT’s website, we decided to combine Wayfair’s
                challenge of addressing the housing inequality crisis through the incorporation of ESRI technology,
                specifically the ArcGIS platform. After exploring this technology, we found that there is already
                an ESRI tutorial that identifies areas with high populations of homelessness. We decided that we
                wanted to provide a resource targeted toward low-income families/individuals in Georgia. This resource
                would support them in a search for better living conditions they will enjoy at their current
                income level.
            </p>
            <p>
                Resources Used:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    ArcGIS Pro
                </li>
                <li>
                    Feature Layers in ArcGIS:
                </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Location Affordability Index
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Median Household Income
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Crime Index
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Unemployment
                        </li>
                    </ul>
            </ul>
            <p>
                After more research on the layers provided through ArcGIS and on the housing inequality crisis,
                we decided to use these 4 topics as we believe these are the biggest contributors in an individual
                or family’s decision to live somewhere. Parsing through the attribute tables for these 4 feature
                layers, we then grouped this data and divided it based on the 159 counties in Georgia via the FIPS
                County Codes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our output which is shown in the map below is a product of an algorithm designed by our team which
                provides a range of values with the lower end representing places with worse living conditions and
                the higher end representing places with better living conditions. Each topic was assigned a weight
                that was determined collectively by the team. After thorough research, the team decided to place
                the following weights on each focus area:
            </p>
            <p>
                Focus Areas:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Location Affordability Index: 0.7
                </li>
                <li>
                    Median Household Income: 0.2
                </li>
                <li>
                    Crime Index: - 0.2
                </li>
                <li>
                    Unemployment: 0.3
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p style="padding: 0 0 10em 0">
                This weight along with each focus area’s value for a specific county was used together and formulated
                to get an output that is represented through the map found on the Home page. According to our algorithm,
                Forsyth County offers the most flexibility and support for ideal living conditions.
